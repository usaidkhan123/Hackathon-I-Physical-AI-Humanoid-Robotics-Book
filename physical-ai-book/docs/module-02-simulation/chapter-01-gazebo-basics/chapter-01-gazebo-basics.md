## Summary

This chapter introduces Gazebo, a powerful tool for simulating robots in realistic environments. You will learn how to install Gazebo, navigate its interface, and create a simple world.

## Why this chapter matters

Gazebo is a cornerstone of modern robotics development. It provides a virtual proving ground to test and refine your robot's design and control logic before deploying it to physical hardware, saving time, money, and preventing potential damage.

## Real Robotics Use-Cases

- **Algorithm Validation:** Companies like Boston Dynamics use simulators to test and iterate on their complex locomotion and balancing algorithms.
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Self-driving car companies simulate millions of miles in virtual environments to train their perception and navigation systems.
- **Warehouse Automation:** Robotics companies simulate warehouse environments to optimize the behavior of their automated guided vehicles (AGVs).

## Skills Students Will Build

- Installation and setup of Gazebo.
- Navigation of the Gazebo user interface.
- Creation of simple simulation worlds.
- Understanding of the Gazebo architecture (server vs. client).
