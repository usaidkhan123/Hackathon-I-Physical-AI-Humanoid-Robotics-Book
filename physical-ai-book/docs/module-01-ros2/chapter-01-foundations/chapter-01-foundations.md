# Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI

## Summary

This chapter lays the conceptual groundwork for the entire curriculum. We will explore what "Physical AI" means, how it differs from purely digital AI, and why embodied intelligence is the next frontier in artificial intelligence. We will also discuss the fundamental concepts of human and robot agency and provide a high-level overview of the sensors that allow robots to perceive the world.

## Why this chapter matters

Before diving into the technical details of robotics, it's crucial to understand the "why" behind what we're building. This chapter will provide you with the mental models and a strong conceptual foundation that will guide you through the rest of the curriculum.

## Real Robotics Use-Cases

- **Human-Robot Collaboration**: Understanding the differences in agency is key to designing safe and effective collaborative robots (cobots) in manufacturing and logistics.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: The concept of embodied intelligence is central to how self-driving cars perceive and interact with their environment.
- **Healthcare Robotics**: From surgical robots to assistive care robots, understanding the foundations of physical AI is crucial for developing robots that can safely and effectively interact with humans.

## Skills Students Will Build

- **Conceptual Understanding**: Develop a strong understanding of the key concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence.
- **Critical Thinking**: Analyze and discuss the differences between human and robot agency.
- **High-Level System Design**: Understand the role of sensors in a robotic system and how they contribute to a robot's perception of the world.
