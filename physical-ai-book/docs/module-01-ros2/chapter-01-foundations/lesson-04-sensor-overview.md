# Lesson 4: Sensor Overview

## Lesson Objective

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to identify and describe the function of common sensors used in robotics, including cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and depth sensors.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Lesson 3: Human vs. Robot Agency

## Concept Explanation

Sensors are the "senses" of a robot, allowing it to perceive and gather information about its environment. Different sensors are suited for different tasks, and a robot's sensor suite will depend on its intended application. In this lesson, we will provide a high-level overview of some of the most common sensors used in robotics today.

## Step-by-Step Technical Breakdown

This lesson is conceptual, so there is no technical breakdown. We will explore different types of sensors and their applications.

## Real-World Analogy

Think of the different senses that humans use to perceive the world. We use our eyes to see, our ears to hear, our skin to feel, and our nose to smell. Each sense provides a different type of information about our environment. Similarly, a robot's sensors each provide a different type of information that the robot can use to build a model of its world.

## Hands-On Task

- **Research**: Choose one of the sensors discussed in this lesson (e.g., LiDAR, depth camera, IMU) and research a specific robotics application where it is used. Be prepared to discuss how the sensor is used and why it is well-suited for that application.

## Python + ROS2 Code Example

There is no code example for this conceptual lesson.

## Common Mistakes & Debugging Tips

- **Sensor limitations**: It's important to understand the limitations of each type of sensor. For example, cameras are sensitive to lighting conditions, and LiDAR can have difficulty with reflective surfaces.

## Mini Assessment

1.  What is the role of sensors in a robotic system?
2.  Describe the function of a LiDAR sensor.
3.  What is the difference between a regular camera and a depth camera?
4.  What does an IMU measure?
