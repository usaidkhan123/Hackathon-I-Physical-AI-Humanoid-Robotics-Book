# Lesson 1: What is Physical AI?

## Lesson Objective

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to define Physical AI and explain its key characteristics, including the importance of embodiment and interaction with the physical world.

## Prerequisites

- None

## Concept Explanation

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence that is embodied in a physical form, such as a robot, and can perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Unlike purely digital AI, which exists only in software, Physical AI must contend with the complexities and uncertainties of the real world, such as gravity, friction, and unpredictable events.

## Step-by-Step Technical Breakdown

This lesson is conceptual, so there is no technical breakdown. We will explore the concepts of Physical AI through discussion and examples.

## Real-World Analogy

Think of the difference between a chatbot and a self-driving car. A chatbot is a purely digital AI that processes language and generates text. A self-driving car, on the other hand, is a Physical AI that must perceive its environment through sensors, make decisions in real-time, and physically control the car's movement.

## Hands-On Task

- **Discussion**: Reflect on the differences between a virtual assistant on your phone and a robot vacuum cleaner. What are the key challenges that the robot vacuum faces that the virtual assistant does not?

## Python + ROS2 Code Example

There is no code example for this conceptual lesson.

## Common Mistakes & Debugging Tips

- **Confusing AI with robotics**: While Physical AI is often embodied in robots, not all robots use AI, and not all AI is physical. It's important to understand the distinction.

## Mini Assessment

1.  What is the key difference between Physical AI and purely digital AI?
2.  Why is embodiment important for Physical AI?
3.  Give an example of a Physical AI that is not a robot.
4.  What are some of the challenges that Physical AI faces that digital AI does not?
