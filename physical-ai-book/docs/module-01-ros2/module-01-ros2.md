# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Module Summary

This module introduces the core concepts of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), a flexible framework for writing robot software. You will learn how to create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions, which are the fundamental building blocks of any robotics application.

## Why This Module Matters

Understanding ROS 2 is essential for anyone serious about robotics. It provides a standardized architecture for communication between different parts of a robot's software, enabling you to build complex and robust robotic systems. By the end of this module, you will be able to create a complete software stack for a simple robotic task.

## Skills Students Will Build

- **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Understand and use ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions.
- **Python for Robotics**: Write Python scripts to control and interact with ROS 2 systems using `rclpy`.
- **System Architecture**: Design and implement a basic software architecture for a robotic system.
- **Debugging**: Learn to use ROS 2 tools to debug and inspect your robotic applications.

## Tools & Tech Stack Used

- **ROS 2**: The core framework for this module.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for `rclpy`.
- **`rclpy`**: The Python client library for ROS 2.
- **Ubuntu**: The recommended operating system for ROS 2 development.
