# Chapter 3: The rclpy Bridge

## Summary

This chapter focuses on the `rclpy` library, which is the Python client library for ROS 2. You will learn how to use `rclpy` to write Python programs that can communicate with the ROS 2 world. We will cover how to create nodes, publishers, subscribers, service clients, service servers, action clients, and action servers using `rclpy`.

## Why this chapter matters

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it is widely used in the field of robotics. By learning how to use `rclpy`, you will be able to leverage the power of Python to build sophisticated robotics applications with ROS 2.

## Real Robotics Use-Cases

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Python's ease of use makes it a great language for rapid prototyping of robotics applications.
- **Machine Learning**: Python is the language of choice for many machine learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. By using `rclpy`, you can easily integrate these libraries into your ROS 2 applications.
- **Data Science**: Python is also widely used for data science and analysis. You can use `rclpy` to collect data from your robot and then use Python's data science libraries to analyze it.

## Skills Students Will Build

- **rclpy API**: Become proficient in using the `rclpy` API to create ROS 2 applications.
- **Python for Robotics**: Gain experience in writing Python code for robotics applications.
- **Integration**: Learn how to integrate Python libraries with ROS 2.
