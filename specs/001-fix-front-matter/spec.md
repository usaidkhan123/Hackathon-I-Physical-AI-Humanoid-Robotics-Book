# Chapter Specification: [CHAPTER TITLE]

**Chapter Branch**: `[###-chapter-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Learning Objectives & Scenarios *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Each learning objective represents a core competency the reader will gain.
  Prioritize them based on foundational importance (P1, P2, etc.).
-->

### Learning Objective 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

**As a learner, I want to** [understand/build/configure X] **so that I can** [achieve Y].

**Why this priority**: [Explain why this is a foundational skill for the chapter.]

**Independent Test**: The learner's understanding can be tested by asking them to [perform a specific task, e.g., "write a ROS 2 node that subscribes to a topic"].

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** [a standard robotics setup], **When** [the learner executes the code from this section], **Then** [the robot/simulation performs the expected action].
2.  **Given** [a set of concepts], **When** [the learner is quizzed], **Then** [they can correctly define the concepts].

## Content & Quality Requirements *(mandatory)*

*This section ensures compliance with the Project Constitution.*

### Constitutional Compliance Check

-   [ ] **Scope Doctrine**: Does the chapter content fall within the approved modules (ROS 2, Digital Twin, Isaac, VLA)?
-   [ ] **Audience Mandate**: Is the material presented in a way that is accessible to beginners?
-   [ ] **Pedagogy Law**: Are complex topics introduced with analogies and diagrams? Is the structure hands-on first?
-   [ ] **Tech Stack**: Does the chapter exclusively use technologies from the approved list?

### Chapter Completeness Checklist (Section VIII)

-   [ ] **System Diagram**: At least one diagram illustrating the system architecture.
-   [ ] **Real Code Example**: At least one complete, working code example.
-   [ ] **Robotics Mini-Project**: A small, hands-on project integrating the chapter's concepts.
-   [ ] **"Test Your Understanding" Quiz**: A quiz with 5-10 questions.
-   [ ] **"Hands-On Assignment" Section**: A standalone assignment for the reader to complete.
-   [ ] **Safety Notes**: Explicit safety warnings for hardware operation.

## Key Concepts & Technologies *(mandatory)*

-   **[Concept 1]**: [Briefly define the concept, e.g., "ROS 2 Topic: A message bus for nodes to exchange data."]
-   **[Technology 1]**: [Note the specific technology being used, e.g., "`rclpy`: The Python client library for ROS 2."]

## Learning Outcomes *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Define measurable outcomes for the chapter.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **LO-001**: After completing the chapter, 90% of learners should be able to successfully complete the hands-on assignment.
-   **LO-002**: The chapter's code examples must run without error on the official hardware/simulation platform.
-   **LO-003**: Learners will be able to explain the core concepts of the chapter in their own words.
