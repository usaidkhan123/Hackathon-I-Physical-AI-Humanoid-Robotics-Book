# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Curriculum

**Branch**: `001-robotics-curriculum-spec` | **Date**: 2025-12-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-robotics-curriculum-spec/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan is generated by the `/sp.plan` command and adheres to the project Constitution.

## 1. Summary & Project Vision

This plan outlines the complete, production-ready development strategy for the technical book: "Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics". The objective is to produce a comprehensive, 12-14 week educational program that teaches the full stack of embodied intelligence, from ROS 2 fundamentals to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems. The project includes the book content itself (managed in Docusaurus) and a fully integrated RAG chatbot to assist learners.

## 2. Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+, Node.js (for Docusaurus)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, FastAPI, Qdrant Cloud, Neon Postgres, OpenAI Agents/ChatKit, Gemini CLI, SpecKit
**Storage**: Neon Serverless Postgres (user/chat metadata), Qdrant Cloud (vector embeddings)
**Testing**: `pytest` for backend, standard Docusaurus build checks
**Target Platform**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano/NX, Digital Twin Workstation (RTX GPU), Web (Docusaurus site)
**Project Type**: Educational Content (Docusaurus) + AI Backend (FastAPI)
**Constraints**: Must be beginner-friendly, constitutionally compliant, and production-ready.

## 3. Constitution Check

*GATE: This plan is fully compliant with the project constitution.*

- [x] **II. Scope Doctrine**: The plan adheres to the 4 modules defined in the constitution.
- [x] **III. Target Audience Mandate**: The plan is explicitly designed for beginner and intermediate learners.
- [x] **IV. Pedagogy Law**: The plan incorporates the required hands-on, analogy-driven teaching style.
- [x] **V. Technology Stack Restriction**: The plan uses the exact technology stack mandated by the constitution.
- [x] **VII. Workflow Rules**: This plan was generated via `/sp.plan`.
- [x] **VIII. Quality & Completeness**: The plan accounts for all required chapter components.
- [x] **IX. Developer Transparency**: The plan includes building and documenting the full RAG backend.

## 4. Repository & Folder Structure

The project will be organized as follows:

```
/physical-ai-book
├── docs/                     # Docusaurus root for all book content
│   ├── module-01-ros2/
│   ├── module-02-simulation/
│   ├── module-03-nvidia-isaac/
│   └── module-04-vla/
├── rag-backend/              # FastAPI application for the chatbot
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   ├── agents/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── core/
│   └── tests/
├── scripts/                  # Automation and utility scripts
├── specs/                    # SpecKit specifications, plans, and tasks
│   └── 001-robotics-curriculum-spec/
└── history/                  # SpecKit Prompt History Records (PHRs)
```

**Structure Decision**: This structure cleanly separates the Docusaurus-managed book content from the FastAPI backend code, while centralizing project governance artifacts under `specs` and `history`.

## 5. Key Design Artifacts

This plan generates the following critical design documents:

- **`research.md`**: Confirms technology choices and best practices.
- **`data-model.md`**: Defines the database schema for the RAG chatbot.
- **`contracts/openapi.json`**: Provides the API specification for the FastAPI backend.
- **`quickstart.md`**: A guide for setting up the development environment.

*(These files will be created in the `specs/001-robotics-curriculum-spec/` directory.)*
