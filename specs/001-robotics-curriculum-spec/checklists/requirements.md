# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Curriculum

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-07
**Feature**: [specs/001-robotics-curriculum-spec/spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *The spec defines the required stack, which is appropriate for a curriculum specification.*
- [x] Focused on user (learner) value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - *The spec is technical but clear enough for curriculum planners.*
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (where applicable)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (Implicitly through "Common Mistakes & Debugging Tips" sections)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User (learner) scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (other than defining the technology to be taught)

## Notes

- The user-provided specification was extremely detailed and exhaustive, meeting all quality criteria for a foundational project blueprint.
- No clarifications were needed. The spec is ready for the `/sp.plan` phase.
